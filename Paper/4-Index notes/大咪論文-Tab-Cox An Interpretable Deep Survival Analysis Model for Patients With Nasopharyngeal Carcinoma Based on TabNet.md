# Introduction
+ survival analysis model
+ combine TabNet and Cox models
+ Using:
	+ TabNet: sequential attention mechanism
		+ extract interpretable features for identifying disease risk factors
		+ 

# Motivation
+ the complexity of neural networks and their incompatibility with medical tabular data can reduce the interpretability of the model
