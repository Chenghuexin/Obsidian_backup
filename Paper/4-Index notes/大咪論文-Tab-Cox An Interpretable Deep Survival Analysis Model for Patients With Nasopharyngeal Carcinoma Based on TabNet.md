# Abastract
+ survival analysis model for NPC (malignant tumors)
+ nutritional status of cancer patients is closely associated with the clinical progression of the disease.
+ combine TabNet and Cox models
+ Using:
	+ TabNet: sequential attention mechanism
		+ extract interpretable features for identifying disease risk factors
	+ Cox: ?

# Motivation
+ the complexity of neural networks and their incompatibility with medical tabular data can reduce the interpretability of the model
