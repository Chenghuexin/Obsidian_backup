# Abastract
+ survival analysis model for NPC (malignant tumors)
+ nutritional status of cancer patients is closely associated with the clinical progression of the disease.
+ combine TabNet and Cox models
+ Using:
	+ TabNet: sequential attention mechanism
		+ extract interpretable features for identifying disease risk factors
	+ Cox: ?

# Motivation
+ the complexity of neural networks and their incompatibility with medical tabular data can reduce the interpretability of the model

# Introduction
### Malnutrition 
A significant factor in the occurrence and development of tumors, affecting the entire course of cancer and serving as the primary negative factor for the adverse clinical outcomes of tumor patients

Previous studies have shown that approximately 40% of patients with malignant tumors die from malnutrition, not from the disease itself
