# Abstract
+ Ultrasound imaging is a reliable modality for detecting and evaluating breast lesions.
+ Its diagnostic accuracy is often constrained by **subjective human** interpretation and a limited field of **view**.
+ In this study, the Vision Transformer (ViT) is used for deep feature extraction and combined with a One-vs-Rest Support Vector Machine (OVR-SVM) for classification.
